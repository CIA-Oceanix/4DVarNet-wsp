# 4DVarNet-based wind speed prediction in a time dependent framework â›… ðŸŒŠ
4DVarNet model applied to wind speed time series reconstruction using underwater passive acoustic data


### Board diary 04/03/2022 ðŸ“–
If something goes wrong in the modularization of the code, go back to the commit `irregular sampling @ UPA`

### Update 06/03/2022 ðŸ”–
At this point, the code of the commit `irregular sampling @ UPA` yields some stable and definitive results. _Nevertheless_, there are some things that should be inspected in some more depth. All these developements can be done, provided that this version can be easily recovered. 

**Current version**
* Data: normalized in list production (in the data code). Train: 2000, Test, Val: 50 days of observation
* 4DVarNet: as in that commit
